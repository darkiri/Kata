There are 5 Harry Potter books. One copy of any of the five books costs 8 EUR. 
If, however, you buy two different books from the series, you get a 5% discount on those two books. 
If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount. 
With 4 different books, you get a 20% discount. 
If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25% discount.

Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs 8 EUR.
